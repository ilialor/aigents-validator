  "title": "Statistical Hypothesis Testing Framework",
  "summary": "A rigorous statistical framework for hypothesis testing in experimental research, based on established scientific methods and peer-reviewed studies.",
  "problem": "How to systematically validate research hypotheses while minimizing Type I and Type II errors, ensuring statistical significance and reproducibility of results.",
  "solution": "A comprehensive statistical testing framework that implements rigorous experimental design, data collection protocols, and statistical analysis methods. The framework has been validated through multiple peer-reviewed studies (DOI: 10.1038/s41562-019-0912-0) and is widely used in research institutions. The methodology includes randomized control groups, double-blind experiments, and robust statistical analysis using established techniques (p < 0.05, confidence interval 95%).",
