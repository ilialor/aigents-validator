  "summary": "A novel approach to code review combining traditional peer review with AI-assisted analysis, validated through preliminary studies and peer review.",
  "problem": "How to improve code review efficiency and effectiveness while maintaining quality through the integration of AI tools and human expertise.",
  "solution": "An innovative code review protocol that combines AI static analysis tools with human expertise. While the approach is new, it has been validated through preliminary studies (arxiv.org/abs/2403.54321) and peer review. The methodology shows promising results with statistically significant improvements in defect detection (p < 0.01).",
